2. Short description of the area:
"Bonn (German pronunciation: [ˈbɔn] (...) is a city on the banks of the Rhine in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with a population of 311,287 within its administrative limits. (...)
Founded in the first century BC as a Roman settlement, Bonn is one of Germany's oldest cities. From 1597 to 1794, Bonn was the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and residence of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of Cologne. In 1949, the Parliamentary Council drafted and adopted the German constitution, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany in Bonn. Though Berlin was symbolically named the de jure capital, from 1949 to 1990, Bonn was the de facto capital of West Germany. After the Fall of the Iron Curtain, Bonn remained the seat of government of united Germany from 1990 to 1999. In recognition of this, the former capital holds the one-of-a-kind title of Federal City (Bundesstadt)." (wikipedia)

3. Reason for my choice:
I used to live in Bonn for about 5 years between 2009 and 2014. I therefore know the city quite well which makes it easy to me to find possible errors in the map (e.g.: restaurants or clubs which does not exist anymore).
