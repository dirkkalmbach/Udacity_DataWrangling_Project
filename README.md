# Udacity_DataWrangling_Project
This is the second project of my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree: Data Wrangle OpenStreetMap.

_In this second course project of the Udacity Nanodegree Data Analyst we were asked to choose a map area from open street map, wrangle it, insert it into MongoDB and do some basic analysis.
I decided to select the city boundary of Bonn, Germany._

The PDF **Wrangling OpenStreetMap Data with MongoDB** is the main document of this projects and acts as a starting point for reading.
However, if you are interested in coding, feel free to study the corresponding document **Additional Informations** (either as an iPython Notebook or a web archive). 
If you like to replicate the code, simply follow the comments in the iPython Notebook which are really self-explanatory. 
The osm-data for Bonn can be either downloaded from the osm-website (I provided the link in the documents) or you can use the smaller sample of the dataset **sample.osm**, 
which you also find in this repository.

 
Happy Reading!
